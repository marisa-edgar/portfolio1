    <h3>Why Coding?</h3></div>
    <p>My interest in coding dovetailed initially with another part of my life that at first didnâ€™t seem related. A few years ago I was swept up by the minimalist movement, and the result was an utter transformation of my mental health. I was able to change not only my own life, but the life of my children at the same time, all by simply consuming less. This way of life has led me to finding interest in other areas where I can apply the simplicity of my new outlook. In the realm of coding, I find that writing the simplest and cleanest code I can is uniquely fulfilling, and I look forward to learning more as this bootcamp propels me towards an equally fulfilling career. </p>
